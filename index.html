# Problem Definition - Urban Heat Island (UHI) in Phoenix, Arizona
* Known as "the country's hottest and fifth populous city" (Lakhani)
  + Heat Situation ()
     - 110°F (43.3°C) or higher for 22 days 
     - 75% of the nights higher than 80°F (43.3°C)
  + Population growth 
     - City growing through "urban sprawl" - the rapid conversion in to urban areas from agricultural land with poor land management ()
     - The fastest growing urban metorpolitan area in the US for five years (2016-2021)

# Problem Definition - Urban Heat Island (UHI) in Phoenix, Arizona

**Urbanisation as the main driver of UHI**

- Remote sensing data showing conversion to urban, residential and impervious surfaces and decrease in vegetation as the leading cause for the increase in temperature in Phoenix &lt;a name=cite-wang_spatio-temporal_2016&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Wang, Myint, Wang, and Song, 2016](#bib-wang_spatio-temporal_2016))
- 
- Effects found most intense in areas with high socio-economic vulnerability based with higher temperatures and less vegentation ()

## Public Health

- Heat associated deaths per year show an increasing trend 
- Tends to be most intense in the low income areas - more than half of the people who died in 2020 were homeless [add citation]

## Environmental 

- 1°F increase in daily low temperatures associated with 290 gallons increase an average monthly usage of water for a typical
single-family unit (add citation)

## Economic

- Urban Heat Island as **"an unintended urbanization tax on every resident, business, and municipal facility"** (add citation)

# Global Policies regarding UHI

## New Urban Agenda

- "We commit ourselves to the generation and use of renewable and affordable energy and sustainable and **efficient transport infrastructure and services**, where possible, **achieving the
benefits of connectivity and reducing the financial, environmental and public health costs of**
inefficient mobility, congestion, air pollution, **urban heat island effects** and noise" 

## SDGs 

- "Investing in parks and **green spaces in urban areas** will help to ameliorate the urban heat island effect and improve air quality in urban spaces."

## Beat the Heat Handbook

- controlling the heat island effect at the city scale by "zoning statutes, urban planning regulations for mitigating heat islands, **transport planning** and **mandates for green cover**"

---

# Local Policies regarding UHI 

## Phoenix Climate Action Plan - Heat Section - 2050 goal (add citation)

- Reduce urban heat-island effect through green infrastructure as well as **doubling the current tree and shade canopy to 25%**
- Have all residents within a five-minute walk from a park
or open space by adding new parks or open space in underserved areas,
adding 150 miles of paths, greenways, and bikeways throughout the city, and transforming an additional 150 miles of
canals into vibrant public space

**What are the estimated benefits of this policy?**

.center[Benefit-Cost Analsysis for Solution Scenario (2020-2059)]

| Solution Scenario | Benefit | Cost | B-C Ratio |
|:-------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| 25% Urban Tree Canopy Cover | $15.3 billion | $4.0 billion | 3.78 |

.center[Source: [AECOM &amp; the Nature Conservatory](https://www.nature.org/content/dam/tnc/nature/en/documents/TNC_EcoHeatAssement_AZ_Report.pdf)]


**However...** Very slow progress (original goal set in 2030) ()

---
# UHI and Transporation
** Focus on the transportation - how does the UHI problem intersect with this particular sector?**

Transportation as cause of UHI 
* Auto-centric design of the city - Low density urban area with city growth based on urban sprawl (Hoehne )
  +  High private vehicle usage 
     -  



Modes of Transport and UHI
* High reliance on public transport in low-income communities which are found vulnerable to heat ()

# Workflow

![](workflow.png)

# Initial Preparation
## Proposing Idea
Planting trees for some hot bus stops to provide shade for people 

## Bus Stop Survey 
- 4,038 bus stops within city boundaries
- 2,850 of those stops have passenger shelters as of 2017 ()
- No tree planting plan for bus stop
- *Nearly 1000 bus stops have no any shade function*
- community interaction

## Completed Plan
- Planting trees for the top hottest 40% bus top with no shelters
- Totally planting 400 trees

---
# Approach - Current approach and issues
## Current approach
* Fine-scale modeling of the urban heat island (Oukawa citation) 

  + Development of MLR and RF regression models (for both daytime and nighttime) to explore the spatiotemporal evolution of the UHI, using air temperature as the response variable
  
  + The division of the models into two periods based on previous studies that reported significant differences between the daytime and nighttime UHI 

## Issues

1. Mostly Large scale research on UHI
2. Datasets are not long-term data, using one season temperature data to train the model instead of yearly data.

# Methodology - Land surface temperature
.pull-left[
1. Obtain Landsat 8 Data and select bands
Obtain every first day Landsat 8 data for each month from 2017 to 2022 - Make sure they have low cloud cover rate
2. Atmospheric correction: To increase accuracy of the temperature measurements
3. Convert digital numbers to radiance: The thermal bands of Landsat 8 provide data (TIRS1 and TIRS2) in digital numbers (DN).
4. Calculate the brightness temperature and land surface temperature: calculated using the radiance values from the thermal bands and the Planck's law -use the result and emissivity to get LST

# Methodology - ENVI-MET

ENVI-MET is a microclimate simulation software that can be used to model and analyze the microclimate of outdoor spaces. The software can simulate and analyze various environmental parameters such as air temperature, wind speed, humidity, and solar radiation.
- We put the meteorological data and bus stops data into ENVI-MET to simulate meteorological conditions near a bus stop. After simulating the conditions, we set the temperature parameter after planting trees to predict the condition after planting trees near the bus stop.

# Approach - Limitation and Extensions
## Limitation
- The resolution of thermal infrared data collected by thermal infrared sensors mounted on remote sensing satellites is generally low. The thermal infrared band resolution of Landsat5 TM data is 120 meters, and the thermal infrared band resolution of Landsat8 TIRS data is 100 meters.

- It is difficult to obtain image data at the same time of each year because each remote sensing satellite has a different operating period, and the revisit period for the same latitude and longitude area is also inconsistent.

## Extension

- A single model is not enough to match the complex evolution characteristics of the urban heat island.It still needs more advanced technology and multidisciplinary integration.

---
# Implementation-Planting Trees

The implementation section describes the planning of planting trees, which is divided into 3 parts:

**1.Preliminary Preparation**
- Identify if the bus stop is suitable for tree planting
- Check if there is:
  + Adequate overground space
  + Pavement requiring removal before planting
  + Irrigation in-place

**2. Planting**
- Type: Mesquite tree
- One tree at each bus stop

**3. Maintenance**
- Prune
  + Ensuring a strong structure
- Irrigation
  + In-place irrigation
  + Cost are divided into equipment installation and water charges

## Personal Weather Station(PWS)

![](https://www.wunderground.com/static/i/PWSassets/overview1.png)

.footnote[ *PWS Work Process.Image Source:[https://www.wunderground.com/pws/overview](https://www.wunderground.com/pws/overview)]

---
## Features of PWS

- Precision: Get weather conditions for users' exact location (not their neighbor’s)

- Visualization: See comprehensive dashboards and graphs of users' station data

- Historical: Archive  historical data so users can always look back

- Share: Share user data and help supplier improve weather forecasting for everyone

## Limitation

- Data maybe affected by surrounding buildings

- Weather data is homogeneous and prone to human activities
