## Background And Benefits

---

# Urban Heat Island (UHI) in the Phoenix, Arizona

- Conversion of land usage - hotter than the surrounding desert
- Usage of AC makes outside spaces hotter especially during the night
- Tends to be most intense in the low income areas - more than half of the people who died in 2020 from heat were homeless

## Phoenix Climate Action Plan

### Heat Section - 2050 goal

- **"Reduce urban heat-island effect through green infrastructure as well as doubling the current tree and shade canopy to 25%"**
- Have all residents within a five-minute walk from a park or open space by adding new parks or open space in underserved areas,
adding 150 miles of paths, greenways, and bikeways throughout the city, and transforming an additional 150 miles of canals into vibrant public space.

# Benefit of the UHI in Phoenix

# UHI and Transporation 

- high usage of cars (highly car dependent), city structure built by urban sprawl into the deserts - accelerates the UHI impact 
- community interventions demonstrating reliance on public transport in low-income communities vulnerbale to heat 
- tackling UHI from both adaptation and mitigation

# Approach

# Earth Observation 

Data sets for detecting and classifying bus stops which have high temperature problem
![Data Workflow](image/Mindmap.jpg)

Progress
- Collect and cut the Phoenix area remotely sensing Landsat 5+8 image
- Contract band 10 in Landsat 8,to create a heat map
- Spatial join remotely sensing image with bus stops points data
- Select top 30% hottest bus stops

---
## Features of PWS

- Precision: Get weather conditions for users' exact location (not their neighbor’s)

- Visualization: See comprehensive dashboards and graphs of users' station data

- Historical: Archive  historical data so users can always look back

- Share: Share user data and help supplier improve weather forecasting for everyone

## Limitation

- Data maybe affected by surrounding buildings

- Weather data is homogeneous and prone to human activities

# Implementation1

The implementation section describes the planning of planting trees, which is divided into 3 parts:

**1.Preliminary Preparation: Bus Stop Survey**
- Identify if the bus stop is suitable for tree plangting
- Check if there is:
  + Adequate aboveground space
  + Pavement requiring removal before planting
  + Irrigation in-place

**2. Planting**
- Type: Mesquite tree
- One tree at each bus stop

**3. Maintenance**
- Prune
  + Ensuring a strong structure
- Irrigation
  + In-place irrigation
  + Cost are divided into equipment installation and water charges

# Implementation2

The budget of implementation section is as the following:

![](Implementation_cost.png)
- Select the bus stops that are not built on the pavement (no removal cost)
- The calculation is based on 52 weeks a year
- Totally 300 trees and 3 years

Budget  = ＄500 (Survey) + 300 * (＄65 (tree) + ＄250 (pruning) + ＄250 (Planting Hole) + 0.30*52*3 (water) )= ＄184,040
