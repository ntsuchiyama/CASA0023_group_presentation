## Features of PWS

- Precision: Get weather conditions for users' exact location (not their neighbor’s)

- Visualization: See comprehensive dashboards and graphs of users' station data

- Historical: Archive  historical data so users can always look back

- Share: Share user data and help supplier improve weather forecasting for everyone

## Limitation

- Data maybe affected by surrounding buildings

- Weather data is homogeneous and prone to human activities

# Implementation1

The implementation section describes the planning of planting trees, which is divided into 3 parts:

**1.Preliminary Preparation: Bus Stop Survey**
- Identify if the bus stop is suitable for tree plangting
- Check if there is:
  + Adequate aboveground space
  + Pavement requiring removal before planting
  + Irrigation in-place

**2. Planting**
- Type: Mesquite tree
- One tree at each bus stop

**3. Maintenance**
- Prune
  + Ensuring a strong structure
- Irrigation
  + In-place irrigation
  + Cost are divided into equipment installation and water charges

# Implementation2

The budget of implementation section is as the following:

![](Implementation_cost.png)
- Select the bus stops that are not built on the pavement (no removal cost)
- The calculation is based on 52 weeks a year
- Totally 300 trees and 3 years

Budget  = ＄500 (Survey) + 300 * (＄65 (tree) + ＄250 (pruning) + ＄250 (Planting Hole) + 0.30*52*3 (water) )= ＄184,040
